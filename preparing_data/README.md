# The preparing_data directory stores scripts+info for downloading data

- download_data.sh
    - this bash script is used to pull data from the nyc taxi trip data repository
    - this file did not work for me so the below python script was used
- download_data.py
    - similar function to the bash script but actually worked on my machine
    - export function to other scripts and use inside for loop
